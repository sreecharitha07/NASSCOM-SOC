## **OPEN LANE**

OpenLane is an ASIC infrastructure library based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.

For this project, we will be utilizing the OpenLane open-source physical design flow in conjunction with the Skywater 130nm PDK. These tools will be used throughout the entire design and implementation process

## **INSTALLATION**

By installing Ubuntu through Oracle VM VirtualBox, a virtual Linux environment was created. This setup provides isolation and consistency for development and testing. The entire project will be carried out within this Ubuntu environment.

Below is the screenshot showing the system specifications of the Ubuntu virtual machine set up using Oracle VM VirtualBox.
